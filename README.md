C# program to calculate the vertices of a triangle in a geometric grid. This will also generate the key from the vertices.
Project was written in Visual Studio 2017 and also contains a unit test project.

Note: If you get this repository to run on your local machine, you will need to refresh the nuget packages for the solution in order to run the unit tests.

Output.txt contains the results from running the application. You can use this (in addition to running the unit tests) to verify the logic.
